Premise:
You have a table with one column, `original_date`, of datatype string
 ORIGINAL_DATE 
20190825
20190826
20190827
20190828
20190829
20190830
20190831
20190901

Question:
Write a SQL query to calculate two more columns â€“

    `end_of_week ` - the date of the next Sunday from `original_date`. If `original_date` is already a Sunday, this field should be the same value
    `end_of_month ` - the value of the end of month date

An acceptable solution is one which works for any valid date in the string format of `original_date`.
With end_of_month and end_of_week computed  ORIGINAL_DATE  	 END_OF_WEEK  	 END_OF_MONTH 
20190825 	20190825 	20190831
20190826 	20190901 	20190831
20190827 	20190901 	20190831
20190828 	20190901 	20190831
20190829 	20190901 	20190831
20190830 	20190901 	20190831
20190831 	20190901 	20190831
20190901 	20190901 	20190930

Additional Info:

20190825 is a Sunday, so the `end_of_week` for that value is still that same date.

20190827 is a Tuesday, and the next Sunday is on 20190901

Restaurants in the area serve various food to customers. As long as customers keep showing up to a restaurant regularly, that restaurant will keep serving the same dish. If no customers visit a restaurant for more than 3 days, then that restaurant will serve a new type of food starting when the next customer visits. Unfortunately, some ingredients were contaminated and caused a few customers to suffer from food poisoning. The restaurants know which food was affected and are now trying to figure out which customers were affected. The restaurants keep their own catalogue of customers, so there is no guarantee that a customer has the same customer ID at each restaurant. All restaurants serve food in the same order. Figure out which customer ate which food.

Sample Data:

Restaurant:
restaurant_id 	customer_id 	visit_date
1 	1 	2020-01-01
2 	1 	2020-01-01
1 	2 	2020-01-03
3 	1 	2020-01-04
2 	2 	2020-01-14
3 	1 	2020-01-11
2 	3 	2020-01-14

Food:
food_id 	food_name
1 	Spaghetti
2 	Chicken and Rice
3 	Tacos

 

Desired:
Restaurant 	Customer 	Visit 	Food
1 	1 	2020-01-01 	Spaghetti
2 	1 	2020-01-01 	Spaghetti
1 	2 	2020-01-03 	Spaghetti
3 	1 	2020-01-04 	Spaghetti
2 	2 	2020-01-10 	Chicken and Rice

Premise:

Tracy has a file that contains a list of actors and the movies in which they acted. She wants to know the top 3 ranked actors from her list whom have acted/appeared in the most movies.
ACTOR_NAME 	MOVIE_NAME
Leonardo DiCaprio 	The Revenant
Christian Bale 	Vice
Morgan Freeman 	Shawshank Redemption
Leonardo DiCaprio 	The Great Gatsby
Christian Bale 	American Psycho
Morgan Freeman 	The Dark Knight
Christian Bale 	The Dark Knight
Samuel L. Jackson 	Pulp Fiction

Question:
Write code in Java/Scala/Python to display the top 3 ranked actors appearing in the most movies based on the count of movies in which they have acted. If there are less than 3 actors in her list, display all of them.

Consider all scenarios - such as, if two actors have acted in the same number of movies, they will have the same rank.

Input Explanation

The first line of input is always an integer denoting how many lines to read after the first line. In our sample test case, we have 7 in the first line and 7 lines after the first line, each having an actor name and movie name. 

In each data line, the actor name and movie name are separated by a ','(comma).

Input

Output Explanation

Print the top actor names to standard output in alphabetical order. You should not have counts in the output, only actor names

Output

Christian Bale
Leonardo DiCaprio
Morgan Freeman

Premise:

Adam is so good at playing arcade games that he will win at every game he plays. One fine day as he was walking on the street, he discovers an arcade store that pays real cash for every game that the player wins - however, the store will only pay out once per game. The store has some games for which they will pay winners, and each game has its own completion time and payout rate. Thrilled at the prospect of earning money for his talent, Adam walked into the store only to realize that the store closes in 2 hours (exactly 120 minutes). Knowing that he cannot play all the games in that time, he decides to pick the games that maximize his earnings 
Sample game board at the arcade GAME 	COMPLETION_TIME
(in minutes) 	PAYOUT_RATE
Pac-man 	90 	400
Mortal Kombat 	10 	30
Super Tetris 	25 	100
Pump it Up 	10 	40
Street Fighter II 	90 	450
Speed Racer 	10 	40


An acceptable solution is the one where it still picks the best earnings even when the list of games or completion times or payout rates change. 

Question:
Write code in Java/Scala/Python to help Adam pick the sequence(s) of games that earn him the most money.

Then, assume you have a variable list of games and their payout rates. What is the best way to pick the games that earn you the most?

Input Explanation

The first line of input is always an integer denoting many lines to read after the first line. In our sample test case, we have 6 in the first line and 6 lines after the first line, each having a game, completion_time and payout_rate. 

In each data line, the game, completion_time and payout_rate are separated by a ','(comma).

The games board may change but the store still closes in 120 minutes.

Output Explanation

Print the game names that earn him the most into the standard output in alphabetical order
